This work has been published
Comparative genomic analysis of _Streptomyces rapamycinicus_ NRRL 5491 and its mutant overproducing rapamycin
DOI https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-14199-6

These code are for:
- Analyzing the impact of the large deletion on the metabolic level by using genome-scale metabolic network (GEM)
- Comparative flux analysis to find rational explaination as to why the mutant strain can produce 4 times more rapamycin
